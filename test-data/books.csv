Pretty Good for a Girl,Tina Basich,When Tina Basich grabbed her rented snowboard and headed to the mountains in Lake Tahoe, snowboarding wasn't even considered a sport . . . yet. It was the beginning, and could have easily gone the way of many other sports and become dominated by male-driven competition. But not with Tina on the scene . . . Comments like "You're pretty good . . . for a girl" only pushed her harder to be the best and to prove she was more than just a token player on the slopes. Representing for women everywhere, she became a snowboarding all-star, started her own signature board and clothing lines for women, founded Boarding for Breast Cancer, and followed her heart, which led her on the adventure of a lifetime.

Almost everyone watching the rapid demise of this American icon presumed Gerstner had joined IBM to preside over its continued dissolution into a confederation of autonomous business units.

Following Brave New World is the nonfiction work Brave New World Revisited, first published in 1958. It is a fascinating work in which Huxley uses his tremendous knowledge of human relations to compare the modern-day world with the [...],0060830956,<i class="fa fa-book 3x"></i>,<i class="fa fa-book 4x"></i>

The Bell Jar,Sylvia Plath,The Bell Jar chronicles the crack-up of Esther Greenwood: brilliant, beautiful, enormously talented, and successful, but slowly going under--maybe for the last time.

It was "the perfect storm"--a tempest that may happen only once in a century--a nor'easter created by so rare a combination of factors that it could not possibly have been worse.

The Egg and I,Betty MacDonald,When Betty MacDonald married a marine and moved to a small chicken farm on the Olympic Peninsula in Washington State, she was largely unprepared for the rigors of life in the wild. With no running water, no electricity, a house in need of constant repair, and days that ran from four in the morning to nine at night, the MacDonalds had barely a moment to put their feet up and relax. And then came the children. Yet through every trial and pitfall?through chaos and catastrophe?this indomitable family somehow, mercifully, never lost its sense of humor.

Jane Eyre,Charlotte Bront?,Initially published under the pseudonym Currer Bell in 1847, Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre erupted onto the English literary scene, immediately winning the devotion of many of the world's most renowned writers, including William Makepeace Thackeray, who declared it a work "of great genius." Widely regarded as a revolutionary novel, Bronte's masterpiece introduced the world to a radical new type of heroine, one whose defiant virtue and moral courage departed sharply from the more acquiescent and malleable female characters of the day. Passionate, dramatic, and surprisingly modern, Jane Eyre endures as one of the world's most beloved novels.

Echo,Francesca Lia Block,Maybe I would become a mermaid....I would live in the swirling blue-green currents, doing exotic underwater dances for the fish, kissed by sea anemones, caressed by seaweed shawls.

A Series of Unfortunate Events #2: The Reptile Room,Lemony Snicket,Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire are intelligent children. They are charming, and resourceful, and have pleasant facial features. Unfortunately, they are exceptionally unlucky. In the first two books alone, the three youngsters encounter a greedy and repulsive villain, itchy clothing, a disastrous fire, a plot to steal their fortune, a lumpy bed, a deadly serpent, a large brass reading lamp, a long knife, and a terrible odour. In the tradition of great storytellers, from Dickens to Dahl, comes an exquisitely dark comedy that is both literary and irreverent, hilarious and deftly crafted.

Strawberry Girl 60th Anniversary Edition,Lois Lenski,The land was theirs, but so were its hardships Strawberries -- big, ripe, and juicy. Ten-year-old Birdie Boyer can hardly wait to start picking them. But her family has just moved to the Florida backwoods, and they haven?t even begun their planting. ";Don?t count your biddies ?fore they?re hatched, gal young un!"; her father tells her. Making the new farm prosper is not easy. There is heat to suffer through, and droughts, and cold snaps. And, perhaps most worrisome of all for the Boyers, there are rowdy neighbors, just itching to start a feud.,0064405850,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AQXM28er0HUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AQXM28er0HUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api
A Series of Unfortunate Events #4: The Miserable Mill,Lemony Snicket,I hope, for your sake, that you have not chosen to read this book because you are in the mood for a pleasant experience. If this is the case, I advise you to put this book down instantaneously, because of all the books describing the unhappy lives of the Baudelaire orphans, The Miserable Mill might be the unhappiest yet. Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire are sent to Paltryville to work in a lumber mill, and they find disaster and misfortune lurking behind every log.

The Ballad of Lucy Whipple (rpkg),Karen Cushman,Dear Gram and Grampop, Please do not address yours truly as California anymore, California Morning Whipple being a foolish name for a duck much less a girl. I call myself Lucy now. I cannot hate California and be California. I know you will understand. California doesn't suit Lucy Whipple -- not the name, not the place. But moving out West to Lucky Diggins, California, was her mama's dream-come-true. And now her brother, Butte, and sisters, Prairie and Sierra, seem to be Westerners at heart, too. For Lucy, Lucky Diggins is hardly a town at all -- just a bunch of ramshackle tents and tobacco-spitting miners.

The Midwife's Apprentice (rpkg),Karen Cushman,'Like Cushman's 1995 Newbery Honor Book, Catherine, Called Birdy, this novel is about a strong young woman in medieval England who finds her own way home.

She gets the village midwife to take her in, befriends a cat, names herself Alyce, and learns something about delivering babies. When she fails, she runs away, but she picks herself up again and returns to work and independence.' --ALA Booklist (starred review).

Chasing Redbird,Sharon Creech,It started out as an ordinary summer. But the minute thirteen-year-old Zinny covered the old, overgrown trail that ran through the woods behind her family's house, she realized that things were about to change. Right from the start, Zinny knew that uncovering the trail would be more than just a summer project. It was her chance to finally make people notice her, and to have a place she could call her very own. But more than that, Zinny knew that the trail somehow held the key to all kinds of questions.

A Series of Unfortunate Events #1: The Bad Beginning,Lemony Snicket,Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire are intelligent children. They are charming, and resourceful, and have pleasant facial features. Unfortunately, they are exceptionally unlucky. In the first two books alone, the three youngsters encounter a greedy and repulsive villain, itchy clothing, a disastrous fire, a plot to steal their fortune, a lumpy bed, a deadly serpent, a large brass reading lamp, a long knife, and a terrible odour. In the tradition of great storytellers, from Dickens to Dahl, comes an exquisitely dark comedy that is both literary and irreverent, hilarious and deftly crafted. Never before has a tale of three likeable and unfortunate children been quite so enchanting, or quite so uproariously unhappy.

The Village by the Sea,Anita Desai,A classic of our time Untouched by the twentieth century, Thul, the small fishing village near Bombay, is still ruled by the age-old seasonal rhythms. Hari and Lila have lived in the village all their lives, but their family is now desperately down on its luck. Their father drinks; their mother is seriously ill; and there is no money to keep them fed and clothed. Delicately and exquisitely executed, Anita Desai?s gentle and probing story traces the evolution of Hari and Lila into adults as each of them faces the family?s predicament?just as the first signs of industrial India creep into their villages.,0140118861,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=U-CGPwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=U-CGPwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

The last picture show,Larry McMurtry,"The Last Picture Show" is one of Larry McMurtry's most powerful, memorable novels -- the basis for the enormously popular movie of the same name. Set in a small, dusty, Texas town, "The Last Picture Show" introduced the characters of Jacy, Duane, and Sonny: teenagers stumbling toward adulthood, discovering the beguiling mysteries of sex and the even more baffling mysteries of love. Populated by a wonderful cast of eccentrics and animated by McMurtry's wry and raucous humor, "The Last Picture Show" is wild, heartbreaking, and poignant -- a coming-of-age novel that resonates with the magical passion of youth.,014005183X,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tnxKac159vUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tnxKac159vUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

The Portable Nietzsche,Friedrich Nietzsche,The works of Friedrich Nietzsche have fascinated readers around the world ever since the publication of his first book more than a hundred years ago. As Walter Kaufmann, one of the world?s leading authorities on Nietzsche, notes in his introduction, ?Few writers in any age were so full of ideas,? and few writers have been so consistently misinterpreted. The Portable Nietzsche includes Kaufmann?s definitive translations of the complete and unabridged texts of Nietzsche?s four major works: Twilight of the Idols, The Antichrist, Nietzsche Contra Wagner and Thus Spoke Zarathustra.

The Grapes of Wrath,John Steinbeck,Shocking and controversial when it was first published in 1939, Steinbeck's Pulitzer Prize-winning epic remains his undisputed masterpiece. Set against the background of dust bowl Oklahoma and Californian migrant life, it tells of the Joad family, who, like thousands of others, are forced to travel West in search of the promised land. Their story is one of false hopes, thwarted desires and broken dreams, yet out of their suffering Steinbeck created a drama that is intensely human yet majestic in its scale and moral vision; an eloquent tribute to the endurance and dignity of the human spirit.,0140042393,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hNisMz5W1DQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hNisMz5W1DQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Beyond Redemption,Jennifer Dabbs,Katie Mitchell is a well brought up Catholic girl in the dark ages of the nineteen fifties. Her father loves her very much. Her mother values piety and chastity above all. This is a brave and funny novel about falling rapturously in love and being condemned for it; about wakening sensibility and constraint, and about finding oneself growing up in spite of the voices that say 'no'. Initially published by Penguin in 1987, this Australian classic is being re-published as a 20th Anniversary celebration. ."Beyond redemption is one of our truly great novels.

Memoirs of a Geisha,Arthur Golden,This story is a rare and utterly engaging experience. It tells the extraordinary story of a geisha -summoning up a quarter century from 1929 to the post-war years of Japan's dramatic history, and opening a window into a half-hidden world of eroticism and enchantment, exploitation and degradation. A young peasant girl is sold as servant and apprentice to a renowned geisha house. She tells her story many years later from the Waldorf Astoria in New York. Her memoirs conjure up the perfection and the ugliness of life behind rice-paper screens, where young girls learn the arts of geisha - dancing and singing, how to wind the kimono, how to walk and pour tea, and how to beguile the land's most powerful men.,0099771519,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XXj94EDmo2oC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XXj94EDmo2oC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Winterflight,Joseph Bayly,What does it mean to live as a Christian under a government with laws contrary to God's laws? More relevant today than when it was first published 25 years ago. Imagine an America not too many years distant. An America where abortion is the rule for imperfect fetuses and euthanasia is mandatory at age 75. Jon and Grace Stanton's allefiance to God is about to be put to the ultimate test in this future society. As they struggle to protect two members of their family from the law of the land, they must rely on each other and their fatih as they never have before.

The Way We Live Now,Anthony Trollope,Augustus Melmotte is a fraudulent foreign financier who preys on dissolute nobility - using charm to tempt the weak into making foolish investments in his dubious schemes. Persuaded to put money into a notional plot to run a railroad from San Francisco to Santa Cruz, the capricious gambler Felix Carbury soon becomes one of his victims.

Story of the Eye,Georges Bataille,Bataille?s first novel, published under the pseudonym ?Lord Auch?, is still his most notorious work. In this explicit pornographic fantasy, the young male narrator and his lovers Simone and Marcelle embark on a sexual quest involving sadism, torture, orgies, madness and defilement, culminating in a final act of transgression. Shocking and sacreligious, Story of the Eye is the fullest expression of Bataille?s obsession with the closeness of sex, violence and death. Yet it is also hallucinogenic in its power, and is one of the erotic classics of the twentieth century.,0872862097,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MXA3AAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MXA3AAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

101 Uses for a Bridesmaid Dress,Cindy Walker,Bridesmaid dresses -- what are they good for? We've got to pay for them, wear them, and then find a spot for them in the back of the closet.

Aesop's Fables,Aesop,Sardonic, wry and wise, Aesop?s Fables are some of the most enduring and well-loved literary creations in history.

Each jewel-like fable provides a warning about the consequences of wrong-doing, as well as offering a glimpse into the everyday lives of Ancient Greeks.,0140621288,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NrptEU-CtZcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NrptEU-CtZcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Selected Tales,Edgar Allan Poe,Since their first publication in the 1830s and 1840s, Edgar Allan Poe's extraordinary Gothic tales have established themselves as classics of horror fiction and have also created many of the conventions which still dominate the genre of detective fiction.

Attentive to the historical and political dimensions of these very American tales, this new selection places the most popular -- `The Fall of the House of Usher', `The Masque of the Red Death', `The Murders in the Rue Morgue; and `The Purloined Letter' -- alongside less well-known travel narratives, metaphysical essays and political satires.,0140621164,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=I3Cr9l-I_CIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=I3Cr9l-I_CIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

The Tempest,William Shakespeare,Performed variously as escapist fantasy, celebratory fiction, and political allegory, The Tempest is one of the plays in which Shakespeare's genius as a poetic dramatist found its fullest expression. Significantly, it was placed first when published in the First Folio of 1623, and is now generally seen as the playwright's most penetrating statement about his art. Stephen Orgel's wide-ranging introduction examines changing attitudes to The Tempest, and reassesses the evidence behind the various readings. He focuses on key characters and their roles and relationships, as well as on the dramatic, historical, and political context, finding the play to be both more open and more historically determined than traditional views have allowed.,0192834142,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DLuAt0xYOqsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DLuAt0xYOqsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
